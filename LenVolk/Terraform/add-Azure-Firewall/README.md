# Azure Firewall

Hi. So you've decided to deploy the Azure Firewall in your AVD environment. That's cool! I wanted to take a moment and point out that the Azure Firewall is an expensive service to deploy. It clocks in at roughly $1.25/hour when you have it running. Please take that into consideration before deploying the firewall and factor it into how long you want to leave it running.

Thanks!
