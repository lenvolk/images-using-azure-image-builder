Create a PowerShell script that:
1. Authenticates to Azure using the Az PowerShell module
2. Retrieves all accessible Azure subscriptions
3. For each subscription:
   - Lists the subscription name and ID
   - Queries all available regions
   - Maps each region's availability zones to their physical zone locations
4. Outputs the results in a structured format showing:
   - Subscription details
   - Region name
   - Available AZ count
   - Physical zone mappings
5. Handles errors gracefully with appropriate try-catch blocks
6. Includes logging for diagnostic purposes
 
Requirements:
- Az PowerShell module must be installed and updated
- User must have sufficient Azure RBAC permissions
- Script should support both interactive and non-interactive authentication
- Results should be exportable to CSV format
- Follow Azure PowerShell best practices for performance and rate limiting
